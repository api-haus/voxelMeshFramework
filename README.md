## Voxel Mesh Framework ‚ú®

Fast, realtime voxel meshing for Unity ‚Äî powered by Burst, Entities, and a clean hybrid workflow that plays nicely with
GameObjects. Build editable voxel worlds that run great on desktop and mobile. üöÄüßä

## Platforms

- üñ•Ô∏èüéÆ Linux, Windows, consoles: Burst, Jobs, full SIMD
- üì±üçé iOS, Android, macOS: Burst, Jobs, partial ARM NEON SIMD
- üåê WebGL 2: no Burst, no Jobs ‚Äî still works great even with realtime edits

## Requirements

- Unity DOTS stack with Entities 1.3.x
- Burst 1.8.x, Collections 2.5.x, Mathematics 1.3.x, Unity Logging 1.3.x
- PhysX (GameObject physics) for colliders

Future: ecs graphics, ecs physics

## Installation

Choose one of the following:

1) **Add as an embedded package** (recommended during development)

- Place/clone this repository somewhere, then in Unity open Package Manager ‚Üí + -> Add from disk, and select
	package path.

2) **Add from Git URL (UPM)**

- In Unity Package Manager: click the + button ‚Üí "Add package from git URL..."
- `https://github.com/api-haus/voxelMeshFramework.git`

---

## Quick start

1. Create a GameObject and add `VoxelMesh` (single mesh) or `VoxelMeshGrid` (tiled world).
2. Add a Procedural generator: one of [`Core/Procedural/Generators`](Core/Procedural/Generators)
3. At runtime, modify the volume using
	 stamps: [`SampleFirstPersonDiggingCamera`](Samples/SampleControllers/SampleFirstPersonDiggingCamera.cs)

## Roadmap

### Next steps

- Sync/Async switch in dynamic budget adjustments
- Voxel queries
- Flexible multi-material encoding in vertex channels: selectable 4/8/12/16 materials, plus a stylized color-only mode
	with per-material custom colors.
- Improve the public stamp API.
- Extensive scene authoring with both procedural shapes and voxelised mesh geometry.
- Investigate 3D clipmap-based LOD with toroidal updates, Octree LOD w/ seams fixing.
- File-backed chunk storage for persistence and streaming of voxel chunks.
- Rolling grids with floating world origin for pseudo-infinite procedural worlds.
- Editor authoring: procedural scene stamps and mesh voxelization for complex voxel levels in-editor.
- Seamless mesh destruction: embed voxels inside arbitrary meshes with partial voxelization at runtime.
- Additional samples and authoring tools.
- Dual Contouring implementation (Hermite/QEF) for exact sharp features.
- Marching Cubes as a compatibility baseline.
